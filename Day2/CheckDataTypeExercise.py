"""
Even though the underscore is there to make the large number more readable, 
because there is a decimal point it is still a Float. 
If you printed the number in your code, 
it would be stripped down to 734529.678

In Python, the use of underscores (_) within numeric literals is allowed and is often used 
to improve readability of large numbers. These underscores do not affect the type of the number.
